%\subsection*{Conclusion}
%\label{sec:conclusion_doc_analysis}

In this paper we have examined approaches to estimate the understandability of health Web pages, including the impact of HTML preprocessing techniques, and how to integrate these within retrieval methods to provide more understandable search results for people seeking health information. 

%The empirical experiments suggested that: (1) machine learning methods based on regression are best suited to estimate the understandability of health Web pages; (2) preprocessing does affect effectiveness (both for understandability prediction and document retrieval), although, compared to other methods, ML-based methods for understandability estimation are less subject to variability due to poor preprocessing; (3) learning to rank methods can be specifically trained to promote more understandable search results. 

The empirical experiments suggested that:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
	\item machine learning methods based on regression are best suited to estimate the understandability of health Web pages;
	\item preprocessing does affect effectiveness (both for understandability prediction and document retrieval), although, compared to other methods, ML-based methods for understandability estimation are less subject to variability caused by poor preprocessing;
	\item learning to rank methods can be specifically trained to promote more understandable search results, while still providing an effective trade off with topical relevance.
\end{enumerate} 

This paper makes a clear contribution to improving search engines tailored to consumer health search because it thoroughly investigates promises and pitfalls of understandability estimations and their integration into retrieval methods. The paper further highlights which methods and settings do provide better search results to health information seekers. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dist}, these methods would clearly improve current health-focused search engines.
