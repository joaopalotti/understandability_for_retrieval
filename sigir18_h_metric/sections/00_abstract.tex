Relevance is multidimensional. But evaluation campaigns are still measuring it as if it were purely based on topicality. 
One reason for that might be the lack of evaluation metrics/frameworks that incorporate another dimension other than topicality.
In this paper, we propose a generic framework to measure multidimensional relevance.

%With two experiments, we compare our framework, named $H$, to UBIRE, an existing framework used in the context of consumer health search
Through experiments with synthetic systems and a correlation analysis, we compare our framework, named $H$, to UBIRE, an existing framework used in the context of consumer health search.

%We propose two experiments to compare our framework, named $H$, to UBIRE, an existing framework used in the context of consumer health search.
%Firstly, we employ synthetic systems, which allows having fine-grained control, to understand the advantages of H over UBIRE.
%Secondly, we study the rank correlations of systems evaluated with metrics in $H$ and UBIRE.
%
We conclude that while system correlations measured by metrics in $H$ are not discrepant from the ones reached by UBIRE,
$H$ provides more information to researchers/experimenters, allowing them to easily assess and control how each relevance dimension contributes to the final score of a system.
