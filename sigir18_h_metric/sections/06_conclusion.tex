\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed a new framework to evaluate multi-dimensional search engines called $H$.
We compare $H$ to UBIRE, a framework that has been used in recent years to evaluate systems in the consumer health search domain.
Our experiments demonstrated that while $H$ correlated well with UBIRE (i.e. they have equivalent power to rank and distinguish good systems),
$H$ has the advantage of allowing experimenters to easily understand how well their systems are working.
