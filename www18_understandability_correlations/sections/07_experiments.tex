\section{Integrating Understandability into Retrieval}
\label{sec:experiments}

% Modified this section to the simple present as we are talking about what we will do in the next section. Next section we use the simple past because we are reporting the experiments that we have already done. I think that is what makes more sense :P  (apart from the fact that changing from past to present we gain some space removing work endings)

%We investigate how understandability estimations could be used and integrated into retrieval methods to increase the quality of search results. We first investigate re-ranking search results from an initial run purely based on understandability estimations. 
We investigated how understandability estimations can be integrated into retrieval methods to increase the quality of search results. %We start by evaluating re-ranking search results purely basing on understandability estimations. 
Specifically, we considered three retrieval methods of differing quality for the initial retrieval. These included the best two runs submitted to each CLEF task, and a plain BM25 baseline (default Terrier parameters: $b=0.75$ and $k1=1.2$). As understandability estimators we used the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) regressor\footnote{For assessed documents, we used 10-fold cross validation, training XGB on 90\% of the data, and used its predictions for the remaining 10\%. For unassessed documents, we trained XGB on all assessed data, and applied this model to generate predictions. Different machine learning methods and feature selection schemes were experimented with; results are available in the online appendix. XGB was selected because its results were the best, although other methods followed similar trends.}\cite{chen16}, as well as SMOG for CLEF 2015 and DCI for CLEF 2016. These were the best performing approaches from Section~\ref{sec:beyond_readability}.

To integrate understandability estimators into the retrieval process, we first investigated \textit{re-ranking} search results from the initial runs purely based on the understandability estimations. 
If all the search results from a run were considered, then such a re-ranking method may place at early ranks Web pages highly likely to be understandable, but possibly less likely to be topically relevant. To balance relevance and understandability, we only re-ranked the first $k$ documents. We explored rank cut-offs $k = [15, 20, 50]$. Because evaluation was performed with respect to the first $n=10$ rank positions, the setting $k=15$ provided a conservative re-ranking of search results, while, $k=50$ provided a less conservative re-ranking approach. Results are presented in Section~\ref{results:reranking}.

As an alternative to the previous two-step ranking strategy for combining topical relevance and understandability, we explored the \textit{fusion} of two search results lists separately obtained for relevance and understandability. For this, we used the Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) method~\cite{cormack09}, which was shown effective for combining two lists of search results based on their documents \textit{ranks}, rather than scores. This approach was selected above score-based fusion methods because of the different scoring strategies and distributions employed when scoring for relevance compared to for understandability. For relevance, we uses, separately, the three methods used for re-ranking (ECNU~\cite{song15} and KISTI~\cite{oh15} for CLEF2015, GUIR~\cite{soldaini16} and ECNU~\cite{song16} for CLEF 2016, and BM25 for both collections). For understandability, we used, separately, the estimations from SMOG/DCI and XGB. Also for this approach, we studied limiting the ranking of results to be considered by the methods across the cut-offs $k=[15, 20, 50]$. Results are presented in Section~\ref{results:fusion}.

Finally, we considered a third alternative to combine relevance and understandability: using \textit{learning to rank} with features derived from retrieval methods (IR features) and understandability estimators.
With the CLEF 2016 collection, we explored five combinations of label attribution and feature sets, maintaining the same pairwise learning to rank algorithm based on tree boosting (XGB).
These combinations are listed in Table~\ref{tab:ltr}, with $R$ being the relevance of documents and $U$ their understandability assessments. While the definition of Combo 1, 2 are straightforward, the other methods deserve some further explanation. In Combo 3, a penalty was proportionally assigned to documents according to how far their understandability assessment was from a target score $U$ (we used $U=40$). For example, a document with understandability 100 received no penalty, as 100 was the easiest level of understanding, while another with understandability 50 received a 50\% penalty, meaning that its relevance score was halved. Combo 4 and 5 were based on a fixed threshold on the understandability assessment: if the assessment was higher than the threshold $U=40$, then the original relevance score (for Combo 4) or a boosted value (for Combo 5) was assigned to the corresponding document.

\section{Evaluation of Understandability Retrieval}
\label{sec:results}


\input{tables/tab_experiments}

Results for the considered retrieval methods are reported in Table~\ref{tab:experiments}. We reported only the results for CLEF 2016 for brevity; those for CLEF 2015 exhibited similar trends and are included in the online appendix. The effectiveness of the top two submissions to CLEF 2016 and the BM25 baseline are reported at indices 1-3 of Table~\ref{tab:experiments}. Statistically significant differences compared to the best CLEF 2016 run, GUIR, are reported with $\diamond$; differences between an original run (indices 1-3) and its modifications are reported with $\dagger$ (paired, two-tail t-test, $p<0.05$). Note that the baseline BM25 is significantly worse than GUIR across all measures. 

%We start our experiments by showing at the top of Table~\ref{tab:experiments} (indices 1-3) the performance of the top 3 systems in CLEF eHealth 2016 together with a straightforward BM25 baseline run made with Terrier toolkit. Our further experiments will use not only these runs as a comparison base, but modify these runs when necessary.


\subsection{Re-ranking}
\label{results:reranking}

Indices 4-12 of Table~\ref{tab:experiments} report the results of re-ranking methods applied to the runs listed at indices 1-3. Re-ranking was applied based on the DCI score of each document calculated using the preprocessing combination of Boilerpipe and ForcePeriod (best according to Pearson correlation, from Table~\ref{tab:top_corr_metrics}).
We found that the relevance of the re-ranked runs (as measured by $RBP_r$ and $RBP_r^*$) significantly decreased, compared to the original runs: e.g.,  re-ranking the top 15 search results using DCI  made $RBP_r$ decreasing from 25.28 to 21.58. However, these re-ranked results were significantly more understandable: for the previous example, $RBP_u$ passed from 42.08 to 47.09.
%Also note the limitation of uRBP metrics to reveal such a effect, as both relevance and understandability are tied together in one single score.

In the experiments, we also studied the influence of the numbers of documents considered for re-ranking (cut-off). Indices 4-6 refer to re-ranking only the top $n=15$ documents from the original runs; 7-9 refer to the first $n=20$; and 10-12 to the first $n=50$. The results show that the more documents are considered for re-ranking, the more degradation in $RBP_r$ effectiveness. Considering understandability-only in the evaluation, shows mixed results. Similar trends are observed for evaluation measures that consider understandability ($RBP$ and $RBP_u$), however with some exceptions. For example, an increase in $uRBP$ is observed when re-ranking ECNU using the top 50 results. 

Note that with the increase of the number of documents considered for re-ranking, there is an increase in number of unassessed documents being considered by the evaluation measures. Both the RBP residuals and the column \textit{Unj} quantify the effect unassessed documents have on evaluation. Nevertheless, we note that if unassessed documents are excluded from the evaluation, similar trends are observed, e.g. compare findings with those for $uRBP^*$, $RBP_r^*$, $RBP_u^*$ and $HRBP^*$.


Indices 13-21 refer to using the XGB regressor trained using all features listed in Table~\ref{tab:doc_features} to estimate understandability. Similarly to when using DCI, as the cut-off increases, e.g., from $n=15$ to $n=50$, documents returned are more understandable but less relevant. For the same cut-off value, e.g., $n=15$, the machine learning method used for estimating understandability consistently yielded more understandable results than DCI (higher $RBP_u$ and $RBP_u^*$). 

Overall, statistical significant improvements over the baselines are observed for most configurations and measures.  

%Next, we swap the Dale-Chall Index by XGB regressor trained using all features listed in Table~\ref{tab:doc_features}. % When using the set of top 10 features for each group from Table~\ref{tab:top_corr_metrics} results are always better than using an automatic method such as Chi Square to select 10 features to use.}.
%While the higher correlation of Dale-Chall was XXX (as reported in table Y), correlations using XGB reached YYY, the closest method to the human agreement in this task.
%We experimented with different understandability-relevance trade-offs by re-ranking at cut-off 15 (a more conservative method), 20 and 50 (a less conservative method). 
%A similar understandability-relevance trade-off is seen when using a machine learning regressor in place of the Dale-Chall index.

\subsection{Rank Fusion}
\label{results:fusion}

Next, we report the results of automatically combining topical relevance and understandability through rank fusion (indices 22 to 30). We used the XGB method for estimating understandability, as it was the one yielding highest effectiveness for the re-ranking method. Runs were thus producing by fusing the re-ranking with XGB and the original run. (Results for DCI are in the appendix and confirm the superiority of XGB.) 

Like as for re-ranking, also for rank fusion approaches we found that, in general, higher cut-offs were associated to higher effectiveness in terms of understandability measures on one hand, but higher losses in terms of relevance-oriented measures on the other. Overall, results obtained with rank fusion are superior to those obtained with re-ranking only, though most differences are not statistically significant. Statistical significant improvements over the baselines are instead observed for most configurations and measures.  
%However, when combining relevance and understandability for evaluation ($HRBP$) is more stable now than for the previous re-rank methods. 
%For example, compare the $HRBP^*$ of methods that re-rank the top 50 documents per topic, XGB (22.17) and RRF (24.57), with the original BM25 run (23.93).

\subsection{Learning to Rank}
\label{results:ltr}

Last, we analyse the results obtained by the learning to rank methods (indices 31-35). Unlike with the previous methods, we did not impose a rank cut-off on learning to rank. Also, recall that learning to rank was only applied to the BM25 baseline. 

When considering $RBP_r$ and $uRBP$, the results for learning to rank exhibit effectiveness that is significantly inferior to that of the GUIR and ECNU baseline runs, though higher than those for the BM25 baseline (for some configurations). The examination of the RBP residuals (and the number of unassessed documents) reveals that this may be because measures may be affected by the large number of unassessed documents retrieved in the top 10 ranks. For example, the $RBP_r$ residual for learning to rank methods is about double than that of the baselines or other approaches. In fact, among the documents retrieved in the top 10 results by learning to rank, there are 20\% that are unassessed, compared to an average of 3\% for the other methods. (Excluding XGB with cut-off 50, which also exhibited high residuals). 

%We did not impose a maximum rank at which the learning-to-rank methods can re-rank, therefore we focus the following analysis on the metrics that ignore unassessed documents (the ones indicated with a $^*$).

We thus should carefully account for unassessed documents through considering the residuals of RBP measures, as well as the measures that ignore unassessed documents. When this is done, we observe that learning to rank methods overall provide substantial gains over the original runs and other methods (when considering $RBP^*_r$, $RBP^*_u$ and $HRBP^*$), or large potential gains over these methods (when considering the residuals). Next, we analyse these results in more detail. 

No improvements over the baselines were found for Combo 1 (index 31), and the high residuals for $RBP_r$ are not matched by other residuals or by considering only assessed documents. Combo 1 was a simple method that used only IR features\footnote{We devised 24 IR features using the Terrier framework. The score of various retrieval models were extracted from a multi-field index composed of title, body and whole document.} and was trained only on topical relevance. Although simple, this is a typical learning to rank setting.

Compared to Combo 1, Combo 2 (index 32) included the understandability features listed in Table~\ref{tab:doc_features}. The inclusion of understandability features was as beneficial to the understandability measures as for the relevance measures, with $RBP_r^*$, $RBP_u^*$ and $HRBP^*$ all showing gains over the baselines. Combo 3 showed similar $HRBP^*$ values, though with higher effectiveness with respect to relevance ($RBP_r^*$) than to understandability ($RBP_u^*$)

%Combo 3 explored the use of understandability assessments of CLEF 2016 in a straightforward and effective manner. As the goal was to retrieve very easy-to-read documents (those with understandability label 0), a penalty was proportionally given to documents as far as their understandability score was further from the target. A document with understandability label 100 received label 0, while another with label of 50 had only half of its topical relevance score considered.

Combos 4 and 5 were devised based on a pre-defined understandability threshold $U=40$. While Combo 4 took into consideration only documents that are easy-to-read (understandability label $\le$ $U$), Combo 5 considered all documents, but boosted the relevance score of easy-to-read documents. While Combo 4 reached the highest understandability score for the learning-to-rank approaches ($RBP_u^{*}=50.06$), it failed to retrieve relevant documents ($RBP_r^{*}=22.20$). In turn, Combo 5 reached the highest understandability-relevance trade-off ($HRB^{*}=29.20$). Compared to the BM25 baseline (on which it is based), Combo 5  largely increased both relevance ($RBP_r^*$ from 26.01 to 32.60 -- a 25\% increase) and understandability ($RBP_u^*$ from 43.89 to 45.87 -- a 4\% increase). Note that Combo 5 is also significantly better than the best run submitted to CLEF 2016 for both $RBP_r^{*}$ (15\% increase) and $HRBP^{*}$ (13\% increase).
